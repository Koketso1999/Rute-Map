# Rute Map
Rute Map is a tool to search routes and combi (mini-bus) stops in Botswana. By crowdsourcing information, it aims to collect the location of stops and routes which pass through to chart an easily accessible network of combi routes. 

The next stage is enabling dynamic routing when searching a route, to replace the string of stops that show an implicit sort of route.
